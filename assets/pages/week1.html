                        <p>
                            After finalising and submitting the major project proposal, the first week of the major project was dedicated to avatar production utilising Blender, Unreal Metahuman, and other softwares for 3D scanning. Due to limitations in customization and sculpting features, it is nearly impossible to accurately model or sculpt the Metahuman mesh using Unreal Engine to create an avatar that closely resembles you. 
                            <br> <br>

                            My first attempt involved using the FaceBuilder plugin from Blender to model the avatar using several images of myself, including the front side, left, and right profiles. It was definitely better than trying to model from scratch, but it was quite challenging to achieve a satisfactory result.
                            <br> <br>
                            Research has been done on other approaches implementing 3D scanning of yourself to obtain the foundational FBX model using a mobile application called "PolyCam." 
                            I had to scan myself several times, trying different angles, poses, lighting conditions, and numbers of total images to achieve the most accurate and clean result. Sitting still for the entire capture, and trying not to blink too much, was quite challenging but fun. I had to stop scanning at times because I was laughing too much, haha
                            <br> <br>
                            Once it's scanned, it's imported into Blender to clean up the mesh. You only need the mesh of your frontal face without any hair or the backside. Once the foundational FBX model is ready, it's imported into Unreal to be converted into "the Metahuman identity" and to be able to be modified in the Metahuman creator browser. I had to create a few different versions of Metahuman to get the final one, which turned out quite accurate.

                            On 7th March, Thursday, from 10 AM to 11 AM, I attended the first Zoom session as an introduction to each other and to the Seventh Gallery.
                            <br> <br>
                            After the session, I signed up for social media content volunteering and setup for a fundraiser approximately two times a month until June, starting from March.
